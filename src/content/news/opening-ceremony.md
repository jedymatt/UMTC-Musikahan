No doubt being dubbed as the Music Capital of the South, the 20th Musikahan sa Tagum is now officially launched today, February 16, 2023, at the Atrium, City Hall of Tagum, which brings together music artists, choral groups, string ensembles, and contemporary show bands from all over the country to showcase different forms and means of music.

With this year’s theme, “MUSIKAHAN: Pagpalig-on sa Kabaguhan, Kahiusaan ug Kadaugan,” the City Government of Tagum and Tagum City Tourism Arts and Culture Council envision reviving the city’s grandest and most anticipated music festival due to its hiatus causing the threat of the pandemic.

Uy; Department of Tourism Secretary, Hon. Christina Garcia Frasco; invited guests, officials, sponsors, and other visitors.
