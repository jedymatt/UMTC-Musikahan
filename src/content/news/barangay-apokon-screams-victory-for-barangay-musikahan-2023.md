Deafening noises of triumph and victory. This is what Barangay Apokon manifested as they hailed as the newest victor of the Barangay Musikahan 2023 at the City Hall Square, on February 16, 2023, creating a safe space for the young talented individuals to showcase the prowess of performing arts around the city.

With the theme of unity and harmony associated with the diverse culture of tribes, music, nature, and arts, Apokon truly showcased the beauty of diversity among individuals and groups.

Maricar Cababan, one of the victor’s performers, stated that she is grateful that the City Government of Tagum re-opened the doors for Barangay Musikahan on a performer like her. She also expressed that despite the challenges and obstacles of the victor’s journey, the burning passion and enthusiasm to win the competition led them to bag the title as champion.

“... Pero sa among kakugi, sa amoang goal na gusto mudaog, amoa jung nahimo…” she stated.

On the other hand, Dr. Richard Daenos, one of the judges of the said competition and the Regional Director of the Department of Tourism in Region III, expressed his amazement at the turnout of events, and never expected the outcome of each barangay’s performances. He stated that Tagum City deserved to be claimed as the City of Music.

“As someone who is also in the field of the performing arts, I felt that the community spirit is being enriched through [youths] giftedness in music, and for that, it gives me inspiration” he quoted. He also conveys that the Tagumenyos are expressive in terms of recreation of music and uses music as a medium to harmonize the community.
